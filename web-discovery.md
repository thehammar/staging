## Goals

### Business vs Medium 

#### Primary Metric
The **Primary Metric** is the critical unit of measurement we use to determine the success of your Web Presence. 
The essential question is whether the Web Presence's Primary Metric is a monetary or non-monetary measurement. 
If monetary, the Web Presence is an Business: engagement serves online revenue. 
Examples:
* An online store for shipped physical goods  
* A digital goods service for purchasing downloadable content  
* Youtube video channels supported by online advertising
* Political or charitable fundraising, including email marketing
If non-monetary, the Web Presence is a Medium: online revenue serves engagement. 
Examples: 
* Blogs for individuals establishing the author as a thought-leader in their area of expertise. 
* Sites bilding Community through RSS subscriptions, commenting systems and/or  message boards
* Marketing sites for offline products or services such as a restaurants, landscaping or other local businesses. 
Note that the Primary Metric indicates significance, not exclusivity. Business platforms can and should measure engagement, and Engagement Platforms can offer items for sale as a means to establish trust with the target audience.  
The Primary Metric gives us a point of focus for the purpose of the website. 

The Web Presence we are building is a: 
* [x] Business _Success is measured monetarily_
